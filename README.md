# M4R

This repository contains the Python code used for my final year Masters project at Imperial, on the Majorana dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates.

Further details on the project, including the full report, can be found [here](https://azmathabibullah-com.vercel.app/projects/m4r).

## Disclaimer

This code was written over a year ago and there are no guarantees that this is completely error-free. At some point, I will clean up this repository but feel free to submit PRs if you notice any errors.
