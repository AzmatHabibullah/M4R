# M4R

This repository contains the Python code and Mathematica files used for my final year Masters project at Imperial, on the Majorana dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates.

Further details on the project, including the full report, can be found [here](https://azmathabibullah-com.vercel.app/projects/m4r).

## Disclaimer

I cannot guarantee that this is completely error-free. I am aiming to tidy this repository up in early 2023 (building a library with nice documentation) but feel free to submit PRs if you notice any errors.
